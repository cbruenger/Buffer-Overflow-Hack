# Buffer-Overflow-Hack

A lab I performed in CSC 373: Computer Systems 1 at DePaul University





Introduction:

	I did this project for a lab assignment at DePaul University in CSC 373: Computer Systems 1. It was performed on the university's
  server. Most of this READEME file is pasted directly from the directions of the lab, but I omitted parts pertaining to submission and
  grading, and I reworded some other parts.
  
	This project invovles generating a total of five attacks on two programs having different security vulnerabilities.
	It gives firsthand experience with methods used to exploit security weaknesses inoperating systems and network servers.
	The purpose is to learn about the runtime operation of programs and to understand the nature of these security weaknesses in order to
  avoid them when writing system code.
  
	In this project, attacks are generated on target programs that are custom generated. Throughout this explanation of the project I refer
  to calls within linux because they were necessary to conduct this lab. This repository simply contains various code files used in the
  lab and this README file with the explanations of the lab and of all of its components.
